# gufi_query debug prints

## cumulative_times
One type of debugging information that `gufi_query` outputs is called cumulative_times. Cumulative_times is a collection of mostly time values for key events that occur during `gufi_query`. Some examples include `Real Time (main)`, `sqlsum`, and `sqlent`. For the current cumulative_times format, [see first entry in `COLUMN_FORMATS` in cumulative_times.py](cumulative_times.py). The name of these debug values are used for graphing using a [config file](../../../configs/README.md).

Through commit history cumulative_time values are either added, removed, or renamed. Any time a cumulative_time value changed, a new set of cumulative_time values was defined as a known format to parse. Each set of cumulative_times values gathered is checked against the known column formats.

Below is a table (possibly not up to date) listing commit ranges grouped by format. To see all available cumulative_time formats as well as the changes introduced in each one, [see the `COLUMN_FORMATS` dictionary in cumulative_times.py](cumulative_times.py)
* **NOTE**: These ranges are all inclusive [start, end]

## Line format
Each line of the cumulative_times output has the following format:

`<name><separator> <value>`

* **Name**
    * What is being measured eg: `Real time (main)`
    * Each name has a corresponding column in the database
        * Including whitespace, so column names must be referred to with quotation marks

* **Separator**
    * Character that separates the name from its values
    * The current supported separators are a colon (`:`) or a single space

* **Value**
    * Extracted time value corresponding to the field
    * If an `s` is present at the end of the value, it is ignored

**Example**: `Real Time: 32.6s`

### Known bugs

#### Missed NULL Check
* In commit range `b393254, 216ef5b` (254 total commits), there exists a bug in which `NULL` values are not handled correctly. If a selected column contains a value that sqlite passes to the print callback as `NULL`, `gufi_query` will segfault.

* Fixed on [`7cd35f8`](https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/commit/7cd35f8)

#### Thread count > 48 segfaults
* In commit range `831705f, 6bde154` (3 commits) there is a hardcoded value of 48 that prevents `gufi_query` from being run at thread counts greater than 48.

* If you need to run in this commit range with a higher thread count, change the 48 in `struct descend_timers global_timers[48];` in [gufi_query.c](https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/blob/831705f1e0d69e4f322c4108e4bf512fbaebda9b/src/gufi_query.c#L165) to the number of threads you wish to use.

* Fixed on [`86d3d0e`](https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/commit/86d3d0e)

#### Aggregation Error
* In commit range `5ec5386, 1a95766` (20 commits, possibly even further back), trying to use the pentries table will produce the message `failed to create result aggregation database file:aggregate-1?mode=memory&cache=shared: no such table: pentries:`.

* The pentries table **does** exist at this point in commit history. The issue is due to errors in the aggregation code.

* Fixed on [`8480cd1`](https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/commit/8480cd1)

#### Multiple definitions of epoch
* In commit range `54bfc53, d6ec34f` (33 commits) epoch is defined multiple times.

* Some versions of gcc such as 7.3.1 from `devtoolset-7` (CentOS 7 SCL) miss this bug which means it is possible to build these commits.

* Fixed on [`831fe76`](https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/commit/831fe76)

#### Missing fill_queues.c
* On commit `a6631c4`, `fillqueues.c` is referenced in contrib/CMakeLists.txt, but this file does not exist.

* This bug occurs only on commits `a6631c4` and `54bfc53`.

* Fixed on [`69213c6`](https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/commit/69213c6)

#### Errno bug
* In commit range `a4c5fd1, 428398f` (10 commits) errno is not included in `gufi_dir2trace.c` despite being referenced. Will not build.

* Fixed on [`7202174`](https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/commit/7202174)
