\subsection{Extended Attributes}
\label{sec:xattrs}
GUFI supports the indexing and querying of extended attributes
(xattrs).

Reading standard filesystem permissions of files only requires read
(and execute) access to the directory. Extended attribute names are
visible this way. However, because xattr values are user defined data,
their permissions are checked at the file level, requiring changes to
how GUFI stores data. For more information on xattrs, see
\texttt{xattr(7)}, \listxattr, and \getxattr.

Directories containing files from multiple users might have xattrs
that are not readable by all who can view the \lstat data of the
directory. As GUFI was originally designed to only use directory-level
permission checks, a number of modifications were made to process
xattrs without violating their permissions.

\subsubsection{Roll In}
Extended attributes that are readable by all who have access to the
directory are stored in the \xattrspwd table in the main
database. These xattrs are referred to as ``rolled in''.

The rules that determine whether or not an xattr pair can roll in are
as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item File is 0+R
\item File is UG+R doesnt matter on other, with file and parent same
  usr and grp and parent has only UG+R with no other read
\item File is U+R doesnt matter on grp and other, with file and parent
  same usr and parent dir has only U+R, no grp and other read
\item Directory has write for every read:
    \texttt{drw*rw*rw*} or \texttt{drw*rw*\_\_\_} or
    \texttt{drw*\_\_\_\_\_\_} - if you can write the dir you can
    chmod the files to see the xattrs
\end{itemize}

Extended attributes that cannot be read by all who can read the
directory are stored in external per-uid and per-gid databases set
with \texttt{uid:nobody} and \texttt{nobody:gid} owners
respectively. This makes it so that non-admin users cannot access the
xattrs stored in external databases that they do not have permissions
to access.

\subsubsection{Schema}
\label{sec:xattr_schema}
The main database and all external databases contain the following
tables and views with the 3 columns \texttt{inode}, \texttt{name}, and
\texttt{value}:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \xattrspwd table contains all extended attributes of the
  current directory that were placed into this database file.

\item The \xattrsrollup table contains all extended attributes that
  were placed into the children directories that were subsequently
  rolled up into the current directory.

\item The \xattrsavail view is the union of all extended attributes
  in \xattrspwd and \xattrsrollup in this database file.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, each main database file has the following tables and
views in order to keep track of which files were created by GUFI for
the purposes of storing xattrs:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \xattrfilespwd table contains a listing of external database
  filenames that contain xattrs that were not rolled in.
\item The \xattrfilesrollup table contains a listing of external
  database filenames that contain xattrs that were not
  rolled in, but were brought in by rolling up.
\item The \xattrfiles view combines the listings of database filenames
  found in \xattrfilespwd and \xattrfilesrollup.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Usage}
Extended attributes are not pulled from the filesystem by default. In
order to pull them, pass \texttt{-x} to \gufidirindex or
\gufidirtrace.

Note that only xattr pairs in the user namespace (\texttt{user.*}) are
extracted.
