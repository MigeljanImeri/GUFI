\subsection{Printing to \stdout}
Printing in parallel to a single target such as \stdout without
locking results in a jumble of text. Additionally, printing incurs a
base cost in addition to the amount of data being printed. The
OutputBuffers code, in conjunction with the \texttt{print\_parallel}
function, allows for data to be placed into individual buffers of
known, customizable sizes before being written to \stdout in a single
call when a buffer is full.

The \texttt{print\_parallel} function works as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The size of the line to be printed, including the column
  delimiters and newline, is calculated.
\item If the line can fit into the provided buffer, write it into the
  buffer.
\item If the line cannot fit into the provided buffer, lock the print
  mutex, flush the buffered data, and then print the line. This
  maintains the ordering of the data outputted by the current thread.
\end{enumerate}
