\subsection{SQLite Functions}
Several convenience functions are added into each database instance
opened for querying.

\begin{table}[htb]

  \caption{SQLite functions that are available in \gufiquery and \querydbs.}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    Function & Purpose \\
    \hline
    \texttt{uidtouser(uid)} & Converts a UID to a user name \\
    \hline
    \texttt{gidtogroup(gid)} & Converts a GID to a group name \\
    \hline
    \texttt{modetotxt(mode)} & Converts numerical permission bits to text \\
    \hline
    \texttt{blocksize(bytes, unit)} & Converts a size to number of \texttt{unit}s where \texttt{unit} is the \\
                                    & combination of a prefix and suffix: \\
                                    & Prefix: \texttt{K}, \texttt{M}, \texttt{G}, \texttt{T}, \texttt{P}, \texttt{E}, \texttt{Z}, \texttt{Y} \\
                                    & and \\
                                    & Suffix (multiplier): \textit{no suffix} (1024), \texttt{B} (1000), \texttt{iB} (1024) \\
    \hline
    \texttt{human\_readable\_size(bytes)} & Converts a size to a human readable value \\

  \caption{\label{tab:sqlwcontext}SQLite functions that require the context of an index and thus are only
    available in \gufiquery.}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    Function & Purpose \\
    \hline
    \texttt{path()} & Current directory relative to path passed into executable \\

                         & \vrxpentries, and \vrxsummary views. \\

    \texttt{level()} & Depth of the current directory from the starting directory \\
    \hline
    \texttt{starting\_point()} & Path of the starting directory \\

    \texttt{subdirs\_walked()} & Number of subdirectories that were enqueued while processing \\

                               & current directory was rolled up. Only available in \texttt{-S} \\
                               & and \texttt{-E}. \\
