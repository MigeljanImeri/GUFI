\subsection{External Databases}
In addition to extended attributes, users may place SQLite3 database
files into the source file system to be indexed and attached into GUFI
for querying\footnote{An alternative method might be to allow for
users to place simple text files of known names into the source
filesystem for automatic indexing. This would remove the requirement
that the administrator for the index knows what external database file
names exist.}. This effectively allows for users to associate and
query aribitrary data with filesystem metadata.

The extended attribute code uses the more generic external database
infrastructure to track the extended attributes that were not rolled
in.

\subsubsection{Usage}
In order to index a set of external database files that serve the same
purpose, they should have the same basename that will be discovered
during indexing by passing \texttt{-q} to \gufidirindex or
\gufidirtrace.

For example, if SQLite3 files with the name ``external.db" are placed
into various directories in the source filesystem, the call to index
the source tree should look like:

\hspace*{\fill} \gufidirindex \texttt{-q "external.db" "ext" ...} \hspace*{\fill}

which will result in each ``external.db" file being attached with the
name ``ext".

An additional database file, referred to as the ``schema template", or
``template", containing a copy of the ``external.db" schema should be
maintained somewhere for usage when querying. This template file
should generally have empty tables, but nothing prevents non-empty
files from being provided.

Note that the external databases will also be included as an entry in
the index (this may change in the future).
