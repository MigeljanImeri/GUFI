\section{Database Schema}
\label{sec:schema}
GUFI stores extracted metadata in SQLite 3 database files. Each
directory contains a database file named db.db that contains a set of
tables and views designed to facilitate efficient querying of
metadata.

\subsection{\entries}
The \entries table contains file and link metadata extracted from the
source filesystem using \stat, \readlink, and \listxattr. There are
also a few OS specific columns (\texttt{oss*}) that are currently
unused.

\subsection{Directory \summary}
The directory \summary table contains the metadata of the current
directory. Additionally, it contains columns that summarizes the
\entries table located in the same database file, such as minimum and
maximum file sizes, uids, and gids. These summary columns can be used
to determine whether or not \querydb needs to query the \entries table
at all.

\end{figure}

\subsection{\pentries}
The original \pentries view was defined as:
\\\\
\texttt{SELECT entries.*, summary.inode FROM entries, summary};
\\\\
This was done in order to not store the parent inode of each entry,
which would be the same for every entry.

In general, users should query the \pentries view over the \entries
table in order to obtain complete sets of data to query on.

\subsubsection{\pentriesrollup}
In order to simplify rolling up indicies, the \pentries table was
modified to also union with the \pentriesrollup table, which contains
all child \pentries views copied into the current directory.

\subsection{\vrsummary}
The \vrsummary view is the \summary table with a handful of columns
repeated as aliases. This was done so that the \texttt{rpath} SQL
command can be called with column names with those found in
\vrpentries. The \vrsummary view can be used whether or not the index
has been rolled up. Using the \summary table directly with a rolled up
index is possible, but will complicate queries.

\subsection{\vrpentries}
The \vrpentries view is the \pentries view with a few \summary table
columns aliased. This allows for the \texttt{rpath} SQL command to be
called with the same arguments that would be used with \vrsummary.
The \vrpentries view can be used whether or not the index has been
rolled up. Using the \pentries view directly with a rolled up index is
possible, but will complicate queries.

\subsection{\treesummary}
Similar to the directory \summary table, GUFI also provides
functionality to generate \treesummary tables. Instead of summarizing
only the data found in the entries table of the current directory, the
\treesummary table summarizes the contents of the entire subtree,
allowing for queries to completely skip processing entire
subtrees. See Section~\ref{sec:treesummary} for details.

\subsection{\vsummarydir}
The \vsummarydir view provides access to the entire directory summary
and not a partial directory summary (say by user or group).

\subsection{\vsummaryuser}
The \vsummaryuser view provides access to the directory summary for
each user (if this summary has been populated (not by default but
easily populatable via a query)).

\subsection{\vsummarygroup}
The \vsummarygroup view provides access to the directory summary for
each group (if this summary has been populated (not by default but
easily populatable via a query)).

\subsection{\vtsummarydir}
The vtsummarydir view provides access to the entire tree directory
summary and not a partial directory summary (say by user or group).

\subsection{\vtsummaryuser}
The \vtsummaryuser view provides access to the tree directory summary
for each user (if this summary has been populated (not by default but
easily populatable via a query)).

\subsection{\vtsummarygroup}
The \vtsummarygroup view provides access to the tree directory summary
for each group (if this summary has been populated (not by default but
easily populatable via a query)).

\subsection{\xattrs}
With the addition of extended attributes support, several more tables
and views were added into db.db. Additional database files with
different schemas were also added. See Section~\ref{sec:xattr_schema}
for details.
