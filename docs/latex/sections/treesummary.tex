\subsection{Generate \treesummary Tables}
\label{sec:treesummary}
The \treesummary table is an optional table that is placed into
db.db. It contains a summary of the entire subtree starting at current
directory using minimums, maximums, and totals of numerical values.
The \treesummary table can be queried first, using (\texttt{-T}) to
determine whether or not the subtree needs to be traversed and processed.

Because \treesummary tables do not necessarily exist, \gufiquery
\texttt{-T} first checks for the existence of the \treesummary table
in the directory being processed before performing the user query.

\subsubsection{\gufitreesummary}
\gufitreesummary recursively collects data from the \summary table of
each child directory database (or the \treesummary table if it is
available). Generating \treesummary tables using a top-down approach
for each directory can take a long time due to the need to recurse
downwards, so they are not created automatically during index
generation or with this tool.

If generating \treesummary tables using \gufitreesummary, the tables
should be generated at optimal points within the index. For example,
if the index is on a home directory, it may be useful to generate
\treesummary tables at each user's home directory.
\\\\
Example Call:
\\\\
\indent \gufitreesummary \texttt{index\_root}

\subsubsection{\gufitreesummaryall}
\gufitreesummaryall generates \treesummary tables for all
directories. This is done by walking to the bottom of the tree and
generating \treesummary tables while walking back up. This guarantees
that at any given directory, all immediate subdirectories have already
generated their \treesummary tables and thus recursion beyond 1 level
down is no longer necessary. Leaf directories, by definition, do not
have subdirectories, so their \summary tables already contain their
\treesummary table information.
\\\\
Example Call:
\\\\
\indent \gufitreesummaryall \texttt{index\_root}

\subsubsection{\gufirollup}
Just as with \gufitreesummaryall, rolling up a tree involves walking
to the bottom of the tree and working upwards. This allows for
\treesummary generation to be performed automatically during the roll
up operation, resulting in \treesummary tables being generated for all
directories whether or not they were rolled up.
