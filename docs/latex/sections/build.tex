\section{Build}

GUFI uses CMake to generate Makefiles. CMake 3.1 or higher is
required. From the root directory of the GUFI source, run:
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. [options]
make
\end{verbatim}

The recommended options for deployment are
\texttt{-DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release -DCLIENT=On}.
\\\\
GUFI is known to build on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), Ubuntu 18.04
(Bionic), Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal), Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy), CentOS~7,
CentOS~8, RockyLinux~8, OSX~10.13 (High Sierra), OSX~11 (Big Sur),
OSX~12 (Monterey), OSX~13 (Ventura), and OSX~14 (Sonoma). Building
on Windows with cygwin, GCC (not MinGW), and with jemalloc turned
off also works. OpenSUSE~12.3 was supported in the past, and may
still work.
